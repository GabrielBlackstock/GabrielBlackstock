This is a trading indicator that I created using the 5,10,20, and 40 day exponential moving averages. 
I chose these EMAs for use in the volatile cryptocurrency market as they provide a dynamic framework for identifying potential trend reversals and momentum shifts.
The shorter moving averages (5 and 10 days) are responsive to immediate price changes, making them ideal for short-term trade signals.
The longer moving averages (20 and 40 days) help in assessing the strength and direction of longer-term trends.
When the 5,10,20D EMA's rise above the 40D, this would be a potential buy signal.
