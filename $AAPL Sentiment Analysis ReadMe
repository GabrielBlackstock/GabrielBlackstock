# Apple Stock Sentiment Analysis Project

Pleased to share a collaborative project completed alongside Angel and Daniel, where we explored market sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL) stock. Our aim was to understand how news headlines might reflect and correlate with Apple's stock performance.

## Approach
For sentiment analysis, we turned to Natural Language Processing, employing the **FinBERT model**, a pretrained model fine-tuned for financial contexts. This approach enabled us to assess the tone and sentiment of a variety of news sources with great accuracy.

## Data Source
Our dataset included recent headlines about Apple from esteemed sources like:
- Financial Times
- Barrons
- Bloomberg

Each headline was processed through FinBERT to assign a sentiment score, categorising the news as positive, neutral, or negative.

## Findings
Our findings showed that:
- 52% of the headlines carried a negative sentiment.
- 15% were neutral.
- 33% were positive.

This indicates a predominantly negative sentiment in the current news cycle about Apple. This is particularly important considering Apple's recent milestone of reaching a $3 trillion market cap.

## Insights
It suggests a sense of investor caution, possibly due to Apple's high valuation coupled with its declining year-on-year sales. However, these insights need to be interpreted within the broader market and economic context.

## Future Work
Looking forward, our goal is to deepen this analysis by correlating these sentiment scores with Apple's stock performance. This will enhance our understanding of the impact of news sentiment on asset performance.
