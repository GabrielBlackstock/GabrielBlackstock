# Quantitative Positioning Analysis: Correlating Trader Commitments with Bitcoin Price Movements

## Introduction
In October 2023, a period marked by significant volatility, this study explores the intricate relationship between market positioning and Bitcoin price movements. Focusing on a distinct rally in Bitcoin's value, the analysis provides an insightful examination of how trader commitments (CFTC) in the futures market correlate with Bitcoin's price fluctuations.

## Objective
The primary objective is to scrutinise the interplay between the volume of aggregate long positions in Bitcoin futures and the cryptocurrency's price movement. This study aims to determine whether there's a significant correlation that could be indicative of market sentiment influencing price trends.

## Methodology
- Data Sources**: The analysis uses two main data sources:
- BTC-USD Historical Prices: Sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/).
- Bitcoin Futures COT Data: Obtained from [Tradingster](https://www.tradingster.com/cot/futures/fin/133741/2023-10-31) for Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
- **Analysis Period**: October 2023.
- **Statistical Tool**: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship.

## Findings
- A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 was computed, indicating a robust positive linear relationship between the volume of aggregate long positions in the futures market and the rise in Bitcoin's price.
-  Correlation does not imply causation. The price movement is likely influenced by various factors, including speculation about Bitcoin ETFs and other market dynamics.
- The study suggests that long positions reflected in the COT data could act as a leading indicator for Bitcoin's price direction in the analysed period.
